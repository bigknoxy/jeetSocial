# Feature Specification: Kindness Points View

**Feature Branch**: `002-kindness-points-view`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "kindness points view - as a user I want to be able to keep the default feed which shows the most recent post first, but I'd also like a way to see the top posts.  This would be the post that have the highest/most kindness points. Should be easily accessible and be able to quickly swich back and forth."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15
- Q: Which time window should the "Top" view use by default? ‚Üí A: Last 24 hours
- Q: Should the user's selected feed view persist across sessions? ‚Üí A: Session-only
- Q: How should posts with negative or zero kindness points be handled in the "Top" view? ‚Üí A: Include negative and zero kindness points as-is (they will affect ranking).
- Q: Should additional time-range selectors be provided for the Top view? ‚Üí A: No ‚Äî keep only the default 24 hours.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an anonymous user of jeetSocial, I want the existing default feed (most recent posts first) to remain unchanged, but I also want a clearly visible, easy-to-use control that switches the feed to show "Top" posts ‚Äî posts ranked by highest kindness points ‚Äî and to switch back to the default feed quickly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the feed is open showing the default (most recent first), **When** the user selects the "Top" view control, **Then** the feed updates to show posts ordered by descending kindness points (highest first) within 1 second.
2. **Given** the feed is in "Top" view, **When** the user selects the "Latest" (or default) view control, **Then** the feed updates to show posts ordered by most recent first.
3. **Given** the feed is empty, **When** the user switches between views, **Then** the UI displays an empty-state message appropriate to the selected view (e.g., "No posts yet" or "No top posts yet").
4. **Given** two or more posts have identical kindness points, **When** the user views the "Top" feed, **Then** posts with equal points are presented with a deterministic tie-breaker (most recent first) so ordering is consistent.
5. **Given** the user switches views repeatedly, **When** they perform the switch, **Then** the switch is responsive and does not duplicate posts or show inconsistent content.

### Edge Cases
- "Top" view default time window: last 24 hours (ranking uses kindness points earned in the last 24 hours). Do not provide additional time-range selectors in this feature.
- Persistence of user's chosen view: session-only (preference resets on page reload or new session; do not persist client-side or server-side across sessions).
- Posts with negative or zero kindness points are included as-is and participate in ranking; negative values may rank lower than positive ones.
- If kindness points are updated in real time, the "Top" ordering MUST update live so users see current rankings as kindness points change.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The feed UI MUST provide a clearly labeled, discoverable control to switch between "Latest" (default) and "Top" (kindness points) views.
- **FR-002**: By default, the feed MUST continue to show posts ordered by recency (most recent first).
- **FR-003**: When the user selects the "Top" view, the feed MUST reorder posts by kindness points in descending order (highest first). By default, the "Top" ordering uses kindness points accumulated in the last 24 hours.
- **FR-004**: Tie-breaking for posts with equal kindness points MUST be deterministic; the spec defines using most recent first as the tie-breaker.
- **FR-005**: Switching between views MUST be quick and present consistent results without duplicated or missing posts.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST show an appropriate empty-state message when no posts are available for the selected view.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST not change the default ordering behavior unless the user explicitly switches to "Top".
- **FR-008**: All functional behavior MUST be verifiable by automated and/or integration tests (see User Scenarios & Testing).
- **FR-009**: Persistence of feed view preference MUST be session-only and reset on page reload/new session (per Clarifications: session-only).

*Marked ambiguities that require clarification before implementation:*
- **FR-010**: Posts with negative or zero kindness points are included in Top view ordering as-is; negative values may rank lower than positive ones.
- **FR-011**: The "Top" ordering MUST update in real time as kindness points change so the feed reflects current rankings.
- **FR-012**: The Top view MUST use a fixed default time window of 24 hours and MUST NOT expose additional time-range selectors in this release.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Post**: Represents a single post. Attributes relevant to this feature: `id`, `content`, `created_at` (or timestamp), `kindness_points`. (Do not include implementation details such as DB fields in this spec beyond attribute names and meanings.)
- **Feed View Preference** (UI state): Represents the UI state for which view a user has selected (e.g., `latest` or `top`). It is session-only and MUST NOT be persisted across sessions.
