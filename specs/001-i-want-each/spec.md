# Feature Specification: Display Post Time In User Local Time

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-each`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want each user to see the time of the post in their own local time"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: If the viewer's device reports no timezone or an invalid timezone, which fallback should the UI use? → A: Display UTC (canonical) time and label it `UTC`.
- Q: Should the feed show relative times by default, absolute local times, a hybrid rule, or require a user preference? → A: Hybrid: relative for <24h, absolute otherwise.
- Q: When a local time is ambiguous during DST transitions, how should the UI disambiguate timestamps? → A: Show local time only; provide full UTC + offset in tooltip/details.
- Q: How should the UI handle posts whose timestamps are in the future relative to the viewer's clock (possible clock skew)? → A: Show local time with a `future`/`clock skew` indicator inline; tooltip shows canonical UTC.
- Q: For posts 24 hours or older, which absolute timestamp format should be shown inline in the feed? → A: Local short date + time (e.g., `Oct 5, 2025 05:00 AM`).

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a person using the feed, I want to see the time associated with each post expressed in my own local time zone so that I can immediately understand when the post was created relative to my local context.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a post was created at a canonical timestamp of `2025-10-06T12:00:00Z`, **When** a user whose device timezone is UTC-07:00 views the feed, **Then** the UI shows the post time converted to the viewer's local time (e.g. `2025-10-06 05:00 AM` or an agreed display format) and it is clear that the time reflects the viewer's local time.

2. **Given** a post was created 2 hours ago (from server time), **When** a user in a timezone where that translates to "2 hours ago", **Then** the UI shows a relative label (e.g. "2 hours ago") for posts less than 24 hours old, and the underlying absolute local timestamp is available on hover or via an accessible element.

3. **Given** two users in different timezones view the same post simultaneously, **When** they load the feed, **Then** each user sees the timestamp localized to their own timezone and the underlying canonical timestamp remains unchanged.

### Edge Cases
- Display UTC (label `UTC`) when the viewer's device reports no timezone or an invalid timezone.
- Show local time only; provide full UTC and offset in tooltip/details when needed to disambiguate ambiguous DST times.
- For timestamps in the future relative to the viewer's clock (possible clock skew), show local time with a `future`/`clock skew` indicator inline; tooltip shows canonical UTC.
- For posts 24 hours or older, show local short date + time inline (e.g., `Oct 5, 2025 05:00 AM`).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the time of each post in the viewer's local timezone (i.e., the time presented to the viewer must reflect that viewer's locale/timezone context).
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve an unmodified canonical creation timestamp for each post (timezone-independent) for auditing and consistency purposes.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the viewer's device/browser timezone information by default to determine the local time used for display. If the device timezone is missing or invalid, the UI MUST display UTC and label it `UTC` as the fallback.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an unambiguous timestamp format for posts not from the same calendar day as the viewer. For posts 24 hours or older, the inline format MUST be local short date + time (example: `Oct 5, 2025 05:00 AM`).
- **FR-005**: System SHOULD show relative times for posts less than 24 hours old and absolute local times for posts 24 hours or older (hybrid rule). The absolute local time must be retrievable (e.g., via tooltip or accessible text).
- **FR-006**: System MUST clearly indicate when a displayed time is local to the viewer (e.g., via a short label or tooltip) so users are not confused about which timezone is shown.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle DST and timezone boundary conditions so that displayed local times are not misleading; when ambiguity exists the UI should provide the canonical UTC timestamp and offset in the tooltip/details while keeping local time as the default inline presentation.
- **FR-008**: Timestamps presented in the UI MUST be accessible to screen readers (e.g., readable phrase or accessible description conveying local time and date).
- **FR-009**: If a post's `creation_timestamp` is in the future relative to the viewer's clock, the UI MUST display the local converted time with a concise `future` or `clock skew` indicator inline and expose the canonical UTC timestamp in the tooltip/details.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Post**: Represents a user-created post. Key attribute relevant to this feature: `creation_timestamp` — a canonical, timezone-independent value representing when the post was created.
- **DisplayTimestamp (conceptual)**: A derived representation of `creation_timestamp` transformed into the viewer's local time for presentation purposes (format/display decisions are part of acceptance criteria, not implementation details).
