# Migrations Documentation

- Migration files are auto-applied at container startup in Docker Compose.
- Always commit new migration files in `migrations/versions/` to version control.
- For a clean migration, reset the database volume with:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  docker compose up --build
  ```
- The web container waits for the database to be ready before running migrations, using `wait-for-it.sh`.
- If you encounter migration errors, check logs and confirm the database is reachable and the migration files are present.
